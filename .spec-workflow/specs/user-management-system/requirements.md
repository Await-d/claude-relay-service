# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive user management system in the Claude Relay Service. The system will add user-based authentication and multi-group scheduling capabilities while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with the existing API Key authentication system.

The feature represents a major enhancement that transforms the service from a simple API proxy to a multi-tenant platform with granular access control, supporting both individual API key usage and organizational user management workflows.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the Claude Relay Service's evolution into an enterprise-ready AI API gateway by:

- **Multi-tenancy**: Enabling organizations to manage multiple users with different access levels
- **Security Enhancement**: Adding proper user authentication flows alongside existing API key system
- **Operational Efficiency**: Providing group-based account management and intelligent load balancing
- **Enterprise Integration**: Supporting LDAP authentication for seamless organizational workflows
- **Feature Completeness**: Synchronizing Azure OpenAI capabilities to maintain feature parity

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local User Authentication

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and manage local user accounts with username/password authentication, so that I can provide secure access to team members without requiring individual API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new user THEN the system SHALL validate username uniqueness and password policy compliance
2. WHEN a user authenticates with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL create a secure session token with configurable expiration
3. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL implement login attempt limiting and account lockout protection
4. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for protected resources
5. WHEN an admin updates user information THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs and preserve existing sessions if appropriate

### Requirement 2: LDAP Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to integrate LDAP authentication so that users can authenticate using existing organizational credentials without maintaining separate passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LDAP authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL support standard LDAP connection protocols (LDAP/LDAPS)
2. WHEN a user authenticates via LDAP THEN the system SHALL validate credentials against the configured LDAP server and cache user information locally
3. IF LDAP authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and optionally fall back to local authentication
4. WHEN LDAP user data changes THEN the system SHALL support periodic synchronization of user attributes and group memberships
5. WHEN LDAP connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to cached credentials or alternative authentication methods

### Requirement 3: Dual Authentication Mode

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want both API Key and user session authentication to work simultaneously, so that existing integrations continue working while new user-based access is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request includes an API key THEN the system SHALL process it using the existing authentication flow without modification
2. WHEN a request includes a user session token THEN the system SHALL validate the session and provide appropriate user context
3. WHEN a request includes both authentication methods THEN the system SHALL prioritize user session authentication and log the dual authentication attempt
4. WHEN authentication fails for either method THEN the system SHALL maintain separate error handling and logging for each type
5. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN the system SHALL show authentication method statistics and performance metrics

### Requirement 4: User Group Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to organize users into groups and assign Claude/Gemini accounts to groups, so that I can control which AI services different user types can access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a user group THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of specific Claude, Gemini, and Azure OpenAI accounts
2. WHEN a user makes an AI API request THEN the system SHALL route the request through accounts assigned to the user's group(s)
3. IF a user belongs to multiple groups THEN the system SHALL implement configurable precedence rules for account selection
4. WHEN no group accounts are available THEN the system SHALL optionally fall back to global account pool based on configuration
5. WHEN group membership changes THEN the system SHALL immediately apply new access controls without requiring user re-authentication

### Requirement 5: Multi-Group Scheduling Algorithm

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want intelligent load balancing within user groups, so that AI API requests are distributed efficiently across available accounts while respecting group boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple accounts are available in a user's group THEN the system SHALL support configurable scheduling strategies (round-robin, weighted, health-based)
2. WHEN an account fails health checks THEN the system SHALL automatically exclude it from rotation and attempt recovery
3. WHEN account usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL implement predictive scheduling to prevent quota exhaustion
4. WHEN all group accounts are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and optionally route to fallback accounts
5. WHEN monitoring load distribution THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics on account utilization by group

### Requirement 6: Azure OpenAI Feature Synchronization

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want all Azure OpenAI features from the branch merge to be available in the new system, so that users have consistent functionality across all supported AI providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing Azure OpenAI features THEN the system SHALL include all models, pricing, and configuration options from the source branch
2. WHEN Azure OpenAI accounts are added THEN the system SHALL support the same authentication and proxy configuration as existing accounts
3. WHEN processing Azure OpenAI requests THEN the system SHALL maintain identical request/response handling and error management
4. WHEN calculating Azure costs THEN the system SHALL support the same pricing models and cost tracking as other providers
5. WHEN Azure OpenAI features are used THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing API contracts

### Requirement 7: Administrative Web Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want web-based management interfaces for users and groups, so that I can efficiently manage the user system without requiring command-line access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing user management THEN the system SHALL provide paginated user lists with search and filtering capabilities
2. WHEN creating or editing users THEN the system SHALL provide form validation and real-time feedback
3. WHEN managing groups THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop user assignment and visual account allocation
4. WHEN viewing system status THEN the system SHALL display authentication method statistics and group utilization metrics
5. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL support batch user import/export and bulk group operations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: User services, authentication middleware, and group management must be implemented as separate modules
- **Modular Design**: Authentication strategies must be pluggable (local, LDAP, future OAuth providers)
- **Dependency Management**: New user management components must not create circular dependencies with existing services
- **Clear Interfaces**: Authentication middleware must provide consistent request context regardless of authentication method

### Performance

- **Authentication Speed**: User session validation must complete within 50ms for cached sessions
- **API Response Time**: Overall API response time increase must not exceed 10% compared to current API key-only authentication
- **Memory Usage**: New user management features must not increase baseline memory usage by more than 20%
- **Concurrent Sessions**: System must support at least 1000 concurrent user sessions without performance degradation

### Security

- **Password Security**: User passwords must be stored using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
- **Session Security**: Session tokens must be cryptographically secure with configurable expiration and automatic refresh
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive user data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
- **Audit Logging**: All authentication attempts, user management operations, and privileged actions must be logged
- **LDAP Security**: LDAP communications must support TLS encryption and credential binding validation

### Reliability

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API key authentication must continue functioning without any changes during and after deployment
- **Graceful Degradation**: If user management services fail, API key authentication must continue operating normally
- **Data Consistency**: User and group data must maintain ACID properties during concurrent operations
- **Recovery**: System must support rollback to API key-only operation if user management encounters critical issues

### Usability

- **Migration Path**: System must provide clear documentation and tooling for gradual migration from API key-only to mixed authentication
- **Error Messages**: Authentication failures must provide clear, actionable error messages without revealing security details
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Common administrative tasks (user creation, group assignment) must be completable in under 30 seconds
- **Monitoring**: System must provide comprehensive dashboards for authentication method usage, user activity, and system health
